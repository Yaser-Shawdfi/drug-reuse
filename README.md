> An AI pipeline that identifies existing FDA-approved drugs as potential COVID-19 treatments — using **real bioactivity data from ChEMBL**, knowledge graphs, PCA, KMeans clustering, and Random Forest classification.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Drug repurposing identifies new uses for existing approved drugs. This project replicates the computational approach used by **BenevolentAI** to discover Baricitinib as a COVID-19 treatment — using open biomedical databases and machine learning.

**Key results:** Known repurposed drugs (Baricitinib 0.94, Dexamethasone 0.91, Remdesivir 0.90) rank in the top 3 — validating the model against real-world FDA outcomes.

## 🤖 AI/ML Pipeline

| Stage | Method | Library |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Data Collection | ChEMBL REST API (IC50, Ki values) | `chembl_webresource_client` |
| Feature Engineering | pIC50, potency classification, multi-target aggregation | `pandas`, `numpy` |
| Dimensionality Reduction | PCA (2D chemical space) | `scikit-learn` |
| Clustering | KMeans + Silhouette optimization | `scikit-learn` |
| Classification | Random Forest + Gradient Boosting (AUC scored) | `scikit-learn` |
| Network Analysis | Degree centrality, clustering coefficient | `networkx` |
| Similarity Scoring | Cosine similarity on drug feature vectors | `scikit-learn` |
| Composite Scoring | Weighted: binding (40%) + literature (25%) + safety (20%) + COVID relevance (15%) | `pandas` |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yaser-Shawdfi/drug-reuse
cd drug-reuse
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Fetch Real Data from ChEMBL
```bash
python src/fetch_data.py
```
This queries the **ChEMBL EBI database** for SARS-CoV-2 bioactivity data (IC50 measurements for 3CLpro, RdRp, PLpro, Helicase targets).

### 3. Run the Analysis Notebook
```bash
# Option A: VSCode (open as Jupyter notebook with # %% cells)
code notebooks/drug_repurposing_analysis.py

# Option B: Convert to .ipynb first
pip install jupytext
jupytext --to notebook notebooks/drug_repurposing_analysis.py
jupyter notebook notebooks/drug_repurposing_analysis.ipynb
```

### 4. View the Dashboard
Open `web/index.html` in your browser — or visit the GitHub Pages deployment.

## 📊 Key Visualizations

The notebook generates:
- **EDA plots** — pIC50 distributions, IC50 boxplots by target
- **PCA + Clustering** — drug chemical space with KMeans clusters
- **Random Forest** — confusion matrix, feature importances
- **Knowledge Graph** — Drug–Protein–Disease network (NetworkX)
- **Composite Score Ranking** — Top 10 repurposing candidates
- **Correlation Heatmap** — Feature relationships

## 🦠 COVID-19 Case Study: Baricitinib

BenevolentAI identified Baricitinib (an arthritis JAK inhibitor) in **January 2020** — weeks after the outbreak — using knowledge graphs showing SARS-CoV-2 uses **AAK1 kinase** for cell entry, and Baricitinib inhibits AAK1. It was FDA-approved for COVID-19 in **November 2021**.

This project reproduces that discovery logic computationally.
